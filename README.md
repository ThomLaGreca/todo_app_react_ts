# React ToDo app using TypeScript, React Hooks, and Storybook.

A simple application I've built in order to run some examples of different packages and patterns.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm storybook`

Run the Storybook window and file watchers...

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
